# TTT Android Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thestr4ng3r/ttt-android.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/thestr4ng3r/ttt-android)

This is an Android client to play recordings created with the [TeleTeachingTool](http://ttt.in.tum.de/), which is being developed at the Technical University of Munich.

It is an almost complete re-write of the [original Android client by Thomas Krex](https://versioncontrolseidl.in.tum.de/petter/tttandroidclient), following its basic structure, but with the following differences:
* Written in Kotlin (except for code adopted directly from the old app)
* Focus on more recent Android versions (minimum version is Android 5.0)
* Modern Material Design UI
* Usage of the Android Architecture Components: Room, LiveData and ViewModel
* Separating TTT logic from UI
* Downloads in the background using Android's DownloadManager
